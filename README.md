# XMLSploit

XMLSploit is a powerful tool designed to aid in the exploration and analysis of XML vulnerabilities. This repository contains a collection of XML payloads, along with a Python script for testing and exploiting XML-related security weaknesses.

## Features

- **Comprehensive XML Payloads:** Explore a wide range of XML vulnerabilities with meticulously crafted payloads, covering scenarios such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, file disclosures, access control bypasses, server-side request forgery (SSRF), and more.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The included Python script offers a user-friendly interface for selecting and sending XML payloads to target URLs, as well as scanning websites for XML files and potential vulnerabilities.

- **Concurrent Execution:** With support for concurrent execution and customizable threading options, the script facilitates efficient testing and assessment of XML security posture across web applications.
